Tropykus Protocol
=================

Tropykus Finance offers simple digital lending, borrowing, microsavings and microloans products, focused on emerging economies such as Latin America. We seek to incentivize anyone who owns Bitcoin and USD Tokens to deposit to yield their funds while helping latinamericans to get access to fair loans. To achieve this, we leverage the strengths of  DEFI (Decentralized Finance), such as total control over your funds and your privacy, with better savings interest rates compared with the international markets, and lower loan interest rates compared to what latinamericans can find in the local financial institutions. We work to become a real alternative to the traditional financial system and promote change in developing countries, starting in Latin America.

Contracts
=========

We detail a few of the core contracts in the tropykus protocol.

<dl>
  <dt>CToken, CErc20 and CRBTC</dt>
  <dd>The tropykus cTokens, which are self-contained borrowing and lending contracts. CToken contains the core logic and CErc20 and CRBTC add public interfaces for Erc20 tokens and rBTC, respectively. Each CToken is assigned an interest rate and risk model (see InterestRateModel and Comptroller sections), and allows accounts to *mint* (supply capital), *redeem* (withdraw capital), *borrow* and *repay a borrow*. Each CToken is an ERC-20 compliant token where balances represent ownership of the market.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Price Oracle Proxy</dt>
  <dd>This contract controlls the adapters that link the protocol with price oracles.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Comptroller</dt>
  <dd>The risk model contract, which validates permissible user actions and disallows actions if they do not fit certain risk parameters. For instance, the Comptroller enforces that each borrowing user must maintain a sufficient collateral balance across all cTokens.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>TROP</dt>
  <dd>The tropykus Governance Token (TROP). Holders of this token have the ability to govern the protocol via the governor contract.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Governor Alpha</dt>
  <dd>The administrator of the tropykus timelock contract. Holders of TROP token may create and vote on proposals which will be queued into the tropykus timelock and then have effects on tropykus cToken and Copmtroller contracts. This contract may be replaced in the future with a beta version.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>InterestRateModel</dt>
  <dd>Contracts which define interest rate models. These models algorithmically determine interest rates based on the current utilization of a given market (that is, how much of the supplied assets are liquid versus borrowed).</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Careful Math</dt>
  <dd>Library for safe math operations.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>ErrorReporter</dt>
  <dd>Library for tracking error codes and failure conditions.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Exponential</dt>
  <dd>Library for handling fixed-point decimal numbers.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>SafeToken</dt>
  <dd>Library for safely handling Erc20 interaction.</dd>
</dl>


Installation
------------
To run tropykus, pull the repository from GitHub and install its dependencies. You will need [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) or [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install) installed.

    git clone https://github.com/TruStartUp/tropykus-protocol
    cd tropykus-protocol
    yarn install --lock-file # or `npm install`

REPL
----

The tropykus Protocol has a simple scenario evaluation tool to test and evaluate scenarios which could occur on the blockchain. We inherited this feature from the original source code and this is primarily used for constructing high-level integration tests. The tool also has a REPL to interact with local the tropykus Protocol (similar to `truffle console`).

    yarn repl -n development
    yarn repl -n rinkeby

    > Read CToken cBAT Address
    Command: Read CToken cBAT Address
    AddressV<val=0xAD53863b864AE703D31b819d29c14cDA93D7c6a6>

You can read more about the scenario runner in the [Scenario Docs](https://github.com/TruStartUp/tropykus-protocol/tree/master/scenario/SCENARIO.md) on steps for using the repl.

Testing
-------
Jest contract tests are defined under the [tests directory](https://github.com/TruStartUp/tropykus-protocol/tree/master/tests). To run the tests run:

    yarn test

Integration Specs
-----------------

There are additional tests under the [spec/scenario](https://github.com/TruStartUp/tropykus-protocol/tree/master/spec/scenario) folder. These are high-level integration tests based on the scenario runner depicted above. The aim of these tests is to be highly literate and have high coverage in the interaction of contracts.

Code Coverage
-------------

### Recomend ðŸ¤“
Recomend for GNU SO.
Install build-essential package and node-gyp.

    #ubuntu/debian
    sudo apt-get install build-essential
    npm install -g node-gyp

Also recommend seting git pull to [default rebase mode](https://coderwall.com/p/tnoiug/rebase-by-default-when-doing-git-pull).

    #ubuntu/debian
    git config --global pull.rebase true

Deployment
-------
To deploy the contracts we use buidler.

Copy the .envrc.example and rename it to .envrc, change the mnemonic, then use`direnv allow` on this dirally rectory.
Finally run `yarn deploy [networkName]` to deploy to the selected network


Debugging ðŸ”©
-------
Debug in local ganache-cli with VS Code

    #run ganache-cli in a terminal
    ganache-cli --gasLimit 20000000 --gasPrice 20000 --defaultBalanceEther 1000000000 --allowUnlimitedContractSize true -v -k "istanbul"

Configure launch.json (VS Code).

In .buil/launch.json (create if is necesary) add the follow:

    {
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "dev",
            "request": "launch",
